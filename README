A collection of simple Windows batch scripts to start, stop and check the status of the Symantec Antivirus service.

I wrote these due to the Symantec AV Rtvscan.exe process using an extraordinary (150mb+) amount of ram, which seemed to be fixed by stopping and starting the service.

Hopefully these will be useful for others (or better yet IMO, switch to something better than Symantec AV)
